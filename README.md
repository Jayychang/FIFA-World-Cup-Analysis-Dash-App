This project developed an interactive data integration and visualization system for analyzing and predicting FIFA World Cup outcomes. By consolidating historical match results, penalty shootouts, and tournament winners into a unified dataset, the app enables users to explore country-level performance trends through dynamic dashboards and visual reports. The visualization layer highlights key insights such as win probabilities, goal patterns, and penalty impacts, while predictive analytics estimate the likelihood of future match outcomes and World Cup success. The ultimate goal of the system is to provide an accessible, data-driven platform for fans, analysts, and decision-makers to better understand historical performance and anticipate future results.
